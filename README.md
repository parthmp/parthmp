# 👋 Hi, I'm Parth Parmar | Full Stack Developer | Web & Software Programmer

I write software that solves real problems, not just adds noise. With over a decade of experience across backend, frontend, systems, and architecture, I focus on building reliable, secure, and maintainable systems that just work.
